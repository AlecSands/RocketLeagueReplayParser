# Rocket League Replay Parser
master branch: ![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/jjbott/RocketLeagueReplayParser.svg)

Parses replay files generated by the game Rocket League. Parses to C# objects, which can be serialized to JSON.

Currently only a library. The included unit tests show some sample usage.

Completely parses all replay files. If it doesnt, please create an issue with a link to the problematic replay and I'll get it fixed up.

TODO:
* Has some "Unknown" properties that I havent bothered tracking down yet.
